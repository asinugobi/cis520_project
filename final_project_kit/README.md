# CIS 520 Final Project 

This directory contains each of our three models: 

1. Generative: Naive Bayes (`naive_bayes`)
2. Discriminative: Logistic Regression (`logistic`)
3. Instance-based: K- nearest neighbors (`knn`)

Within each subfolder for the specific model, there is a README that details instructions on how to generate and test each model.
